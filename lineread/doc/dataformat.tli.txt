Below is a human readable representation of the TLI format 4.  Each
field indicates description:type;size.  If 'size' is not present,
then it is just one element (or variable number characters for
strings).  Within fields there are no spaces nor line breaks.
Empty linespaces or lines started with a '#' are comments for this 
human-readable file.
