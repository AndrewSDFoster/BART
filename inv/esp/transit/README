    ********* TRANSIT *********


  Readme file for last stable version: 1

========================================================================
DIRECTORIES:

  ./        'Makefile' instructions for complation.
            'README' this file.
            It will also contain the uncommented source files and a
              copy of the binaries after running 'make'.

  ./doc     'template-atmosphere.dat' and 'template-ascii.twii' are
              template input files for a model atmosphere and the
              ascii format of a transition database. 
            'cvstags' contains description of the different releases.
            All the .dvi files from the differents commented C files
              (.txc files) will be in this directory after they are
              compiled.

  ./src     Commented source code is under this directory.

  ./include Headers for the code.
            Functions prototypes will also be under this directory
            after running 'make proto'.


========================================================================
COMPILATION: 
  Edit Makefile to make sure that BIN is the directory where you want
the binaries to be. Then, execute one after the other the following
commands.

   make clean
   make dep
   make proto
   make CFLAGS=-DTRANSITv1 transit
   make lineread

========================================================================
EXECUTING LINEREAD:
  This program is used to build the binary .twii file that transit uses,
right now it can only read Partridge and Schwenke database as prepared
by Kurucz. To get a list of options

   lineread -h

 Right now, it can only read the P&S files from the default location,
hence it requires these two files to run
    ./oth/pands/h2ofast.bin
    ./oth/pands/h2opartfn.dat

-----
 EXAMPLE:

    lineread 1748.5 1828.5 >./res/lineread.twii

========================================================================
EXECUTING TRANSIT:
 To get a help of all commands, run

   transit -h

 Note that not all the commands listed in the help might be available.

 By default it reads the following lineinfo file:
./res/lineread.twii. So, don't forget to use option --linedb if the file
located somewhere else.

EXAMPLE: 

   transit --oneptn=1.1e3,1340,3 --oneextra 2H2,4He,30CO --oneabund 6.5e-4,1e-10,1e-10,1e-10,.80,.14,.00065 >output.dat
