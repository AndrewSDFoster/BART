    ********* TRANSIT *********


  Readme file for last stable version: 1

========================================================================
COMPILATION: to compile from scratch, execute one after the other the
following commands

   make clean
   make dep
   make proto
   make CFLAGS=TRANSITv1 transit
   make lineread

========================================================================
EXECUTING LINEREAD: This is used to build the .twii file that transit
uses, right now it can only read Partridge and Schwenke database as
prepared by Kurucz. To get a list of options

   lineread -h

 Right now, it can only read the P&S files from the default location,
hence it requires these two files to run
    ./oth/pands/h2ofast.bin
    ./oth/pands/h2opartfn.dat

-----
 EXAMPLE:

    lineread 1748.5 1828.5 >./res/lineread.twii

========================================================================
EXECUTING TRANSIT: to get a help of all commands, run

   transit -h

 Note that not all the commands listed in the help might be available.

 By default it reads the following lineinfo file:
./res/lineread.twii. So, don't forget to use option --linedb if the file
located somewhere else.

EXAMPLE: 

   transit --oneptn=1.1e3,1340,3 --oneextra 2H2,4He,30CO --oneabund 6.5e-4,1e-10,1e-10,1e-10,.80,.14,.00065 >output.dat
