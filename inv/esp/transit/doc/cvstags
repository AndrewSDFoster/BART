transit-1pre0: All but Ascii TWII should be working
transit-1pre1: ASCII should be working
       	       Fixed voigt profile (now is an average rather than a
                 sum in a bin)
       	       Fixed total pressure (now uses mean molecular weight)
           KB: Lorentz profile only includes one specie rather
                 than an average 
transit-1pre2: Multiple extra isotopes is working, everything but
                 reading atmosphere file for release v1. Well, only
                 linear interpolation.
transit-1pre3: Atmosphere file reading should be working, tested
                 only for one radius, though
transit_1-0  : Parameters could be given by atmosphere, command line
                 or interactively. Extinction is computed succesfully.
                 Uses version 2 of TWII for first time.
transit_1-1  : Extinction can be computed for more than one radius.
transit_1-2  : Portability and onept output
                 fixes. (transit_1-1_patches branch)
transit_1-3  : '-o', nonnegative abundances, lineread compilation,
   		 significative digits Bug fixes
transit_2pre1: Just merged from transit_1-2. Started working in tau().
transit_2pre2: Inlcudes merge from 1-3. and attempted to get an
               allocation of radius*wavenumber elements... it
               fails. So from here start working on per wavenumber
	       allocation to get an observable.
transit_2pre3: Calculation of tau along a line of sight is working,
               start working in geometry to obtain an observable.
transit_2-0  : It obtains modulation for the simplest
               model. 051804. PMR 
transit_2-1  : Tau calculation is working after a thorough testing and
               debugging. 071004. PMR.
transit_2-2  : Modulation integration is working now after a thorough
               testing and debugging. 071404. PMR 
transit_2-3-rc1 : Never completed. Major changes in atmosphere reading
		  make change of version to 3.0. 072304. PMR
transit_3-0-rc1 :
transit_3-2-rc2 : Big BUG regarding P&S database decoding was found
                  and exterminated, but the result now is too
                  small. 081304. PMR.
