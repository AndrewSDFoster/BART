transit-1pre0: All but Ascii TWII should be working
transit-1pre1: ASCII should be working
       	       Fixed voigt profile (now is an average rather than a
                 sum in a bin)
       	       Fixed total pressure (now uses mean molecular weight)
           KB: Lorentz profile only includes one specie rather
                 than an average 
transit-1pre2: Multiple extra isotopes is working, everything but
               reading atmosphere file for release v1. Well, only
               linear interpolation.
