transit-1pre0: All but Ascii TWII should be working
transit-1pre1: ASCII should be working
       	       Fixed voigt profile (now is an average rather than a
                 sum in a bin)
       	       Fixed total pressure (now uses mean molecular weight)
           KB: Lorentz profile only includes one specie rather
                 than an average 
transit-1pre2: Multiple extra isotopes is working, everything but
                 reading atmosphere file for release v1. Well, only
                 linear interpolation.
transit-1pre3: Atmosphere file reading should be working, tested
                 only for one radius, though
transit_1.0  : Parameters could be given by atmosphere, command line
                 or interactively. Extinction is computed succesfully.
                 Uses version 2 of TWII for first time
