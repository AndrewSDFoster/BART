Integration accuracy:
=====================

Slant Path method (slantpath.txc)
---------------------------------

  When integrating optical depth, the numerical precision of the
result obtained with constant index of refraction is, compared to ray
bending approach, orders of magnitude better when there are several
layers and slightly better when the are only a few. 
  Most probably, the reason is because of using a spline integration
with a infinity integrand near the closest approach point.

  When integrating the modulation, the errors increase when the planet
increase size with respect to the star, and also when the atmosphere
become deeper and deeper.
