                     './.transitrc'.

INPUT/OUTPUT
 -o <outfile>
 --output <outfile>  Change output file  name,  a  dash  (-)
                     directs to standard output.
 --atm <atmfile>     File   containing   atmospheric    info
                     (Radius,  pressure,   temperature).   A
                     dash (-) indicates alternative input.
 --linedb <linedb>   File containing line information  (TWII
                     format, as given by 'lineread'.

RADIUS OPTIONS (planetary radii units, unless stated otherwise)
 -r
 --radius            Interactively input radius parameters.
 --rad-low <radius>  Lower radius. 0  if  you  want  to  use
                     atmospheric data minimum.
 --rad-high <radius> Higher radius. 0 if  you  want  to  use
                     atmospheric data maximum.
 --rad-delt <spacing> Radius spacing. 0 if you want  to  use
                     atmospheric data spacing.

ATMPOSPHERE OPTIONS
 --number-abund      Indicates that given abundances are  by
                     number rather than by mass.
 --oneptn <press,temp,extra_iso> Don't   calculate   transit
                     spectra,  just  obtain  spectra  for  a
                     given pressure and temperature.  Unless
                     oneabund is also specified and has  the
                     correct   number   of   isotopes,   the
                     abundances will be asked interactively.
 --oneextra <mass1name1,mass2name2,...> It only  has  effect
                     with --onept,  a  list  of  the  atomic
                     mass  and  names   for   the   hitherto
                     specified   extra   isotopes.   If   it
                     doesn't  have  the  right   amount   of
                     values,   the    program    will    ask
                     interactively.
 --oneabund <q1,...> It also only has effect  with  --onept,
                     a  list  of  the  abundances   of   the
                     different isotopes. If  it  is  omitted
                     or doesn't have  the  right  amount  of
                     values,   the    program    will    ask
                     interactively. Note that the  order  of
                     isotopes is the same given in the  TWII
                     data file.
 --onept-interactive Wants to give abundances  and  pressure
                     and temperature  interactively  through
                     terminal input.
 --allowq <value>    How much less than one is accepted,  so
                     that   no   warning   is   issued    if
                     abundances don't ad up to that.

WAVELENGTH OPTIONS (all in nanometers)

 --wavelength        Interactively     input      wavelength
                     parameters.
 --wl-low <wavel>    Lower wavelength. 0 if you want to  use
                     line data minimum.
 --wl-high <wavel>   Upper wavelength. 0 if you want to  use
                     line data maximum.

                     use line data spacing.

                     requested range will be considered.

WAVENUMBER OPTIONS (all in cm-1)
 -n
 --wavenumber        Interactively     input      wavenumber
                     parameters.

                     equivalent of the wavelength minimum.

                     have the same number of  points  as  in
                     the wavelength sampling.
 --wn-osamp <integer> Wavenumber  oversampling.  0  if   you
                     want  the  same  value   as   for   the
                     wavelengths.
 --wn-marg <boundary> Not  trustable  range   in   cm-1   at
                     boundaries. Transitions this much  away
                     from  the  requested  range   will   be
                     considered.

EXTINCTION CALCULATION OPTIONS:

                     of Voigt or Doppler widths)  that  need

                     width before recalculating profile.

                     this  allow   displaying   contribution
                     from  different  isotopes,   but   also
                     consumes more memory.
 --no-per-iso        Do   not   calculate   extinction   per
                     isotope.  Saves  memory  (this  is  the
                     default) .

                     field blank.

RESULTING RAY OPTIONS:
 -s <sol_name>
 --solution <sol_name> Name of the kind of  output  solution

 --outtau            Output  is  optical  depth  instead  of
                     modulation.  It  will  be  asked  which
                     radius to plot .

 --telres <width>    Gaussian width of telescope  resolution
                     in nm.
