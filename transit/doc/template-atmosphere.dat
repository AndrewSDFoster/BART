#an isotope starting with '!' is ignored but has to have a column

#lines starting with f contain isotopes that are going to be obtained

#In the following example the 7th isotope will have <fct> times the

#You can use the special keyword 'other' as the reference isotope to
#indicate that the reference abundance will be whathever is needed to
#complete a total abundance of 1.
#The line below sets the abundance of the 8th isotope to <fct> of the
#non-accounted atmosphere (typically used for Helium and Hydrogen
#abundances)
