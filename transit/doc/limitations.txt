Integration accuracy:
=====================

Slant Path method (slantpath.txc)
---------------------------------

  When integrating optical depth, the numerical precision of the
result obtained with constant index of refraction is, compared to ray
bending approach, orders of magnitude better when there are several
layers and slightly better when the are only a few. 
  Most probably, the reason is because of using a spline integration
with a infinity integrand near the closest approach point.

  Modulation integration was very precise for the test cases.


===============================================================
Monotonous Temperature
======================

  Temperature is assumed increasing monotonous inwards. Otherwise CIA
calculations are in mistake. This is necesary for GSL spline.
  Changes to correct this would have to be made at the begging of
interpolatecia function ion cia.txc.
